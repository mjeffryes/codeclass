10 Min show and tell - Anyone solve all the picobot maps? How far did you get on the four fours? Anyone make a different program of their own?

So those programs were fun as far as they go, but kind of limiting huh? It turns out that some of the pico bot rooms are not acutally solvable with the language it supports! (neat fact: you can actually prove this! the pico bot language is called a "finite state machine" and it can't do all the things a "turing complete language  (like python) can!). But the parts of python we've learned so far aren't enough for you to solve every problem either, so this week we're adding loops and conditionals. (See if anyone knows what these mean)

Cool, we're going to make a very simple maze generator today. Lets start by using loops to print a grid:
