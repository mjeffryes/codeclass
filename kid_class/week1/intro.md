What is a programming language?

Why would you learn a language like python to program vs "MyBlocks" or something else?

Today we're going to play with two programing languages that use text to tell the computer what to do.

First, we'll write our first python program.

Then we'll play a game called "pico bot" that has it's own funny language to guide a simple robot

First, some ground rules:
1) Work together! It's a lot more fun to learn a new programming language with a friend! But,
2) Everyone needs to write at least one python program and one picobot program today. No computer hogs, no spectators.
3) For this class, you may not copy-paste or "autocomplete" anything. There are a lot of great resources out there that can show you cool programs, and you are welcome to look at them, but it's easy to copy things without understanding them. Typing out every character will help you think about what the code means and learn to be more fluent at reading and writing your own code.

Get started:
Can everyone open VS code?
Can everyone run python?
